## 📖 About The Mod

**Better Weapons** is a gameplay overhaul that expands weapon mechanics while maintaining the game's **vanilla styling**. The goal is to make combat more skill-based and dynamic without introducing items that feel out of place in the Hytale world.


### ✨ Features / Особенности

Currently, the mod focuses on mobility for light weapons. The standard "Block" is replaced with a **Tactical Dash**:

| Weapon | Ability  | Description  |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| 🗡️ **Daggers** | **Quick Dash** | Short rapid dash in the movement direction for backstabs. |
| 🏹 **Bows** | **Evasive Step** | Short rapid dash to maintain distance from melee enemies. |

*Instead of blocking, daggers and bows allow you to perform a short dash for dodging or rapid closing.*

## 🛠 Installation / Установка

1.  Download the `BetterWeapons` folder or .jar file from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2.  Place it into your Hytale mods directory: `Hytale/mods/`.
3.  Launch the game and master the dash!
